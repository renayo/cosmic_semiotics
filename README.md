# Cosmic Semiotics: Minor Planet Orbits and Astronyms in the News
## Research Summary

### Study Overview
Researchers analyzed 1,211 named minor planets over 290 days (Feb-Dec 2022), examining correlations between their orbital positions and the frequency of their names appearing in Google News articles. This resulted in 351,190 data points linking celestial mechanics to linguistic occurrences in media.

### Theoretical Framework
The study tests five core astrological assumptions:
1. **Brightness/size importance** - Larger, brighter celestial bodies have greater semantic significance
2. **Name-meaning connection** - Celestial bodies' names relate to their symbolic potential
3. **Harmonic angles** - Exact geometric angles between bodies indicate peak semantic modulation
4. **Angle-specific effects** - Each harmonic angle has distinct modulatory qualities
5. **Dynamic modulation** - Celestial bodies continuously modulate each other's semantic potentials

### Methodology
- **Data Collection**: Daily counts of news articles containing minor planet names, normalized and averaged across 360 degrees of zodiacal position
- **Analysis**: Signal processing techniques including:
  - Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) for frequency analysis
  - Autocorrelation functions (ACF) for pattern detection
  - Power spectral density (PSD) analysis
  - Statistical tests for randomness and stationarity

### Key Findings

#### Statistical Significance
All eleven reference points (Sun, Moon, planets, fixed star Mesarthim) showed:
- **Non-random structure** beyond white noise (p-values < 10^-10)
- **Stationary wave patterns** with consistent statistical properties
- **Cyclic behavior** with detectable periodic components

#### Astrological Angles Dominate
The strongest signals occurred at traditional astrological angles:
- **0°** (conjunction) - appeared in all datasets
- **180°** (opposition), **120°** (trine), **90°** (square)
- **72°** (quintile), **60°** (sextile), **36°** (decile)

Additionally, golden ratio-based angles appeared:
- **85°, 175°, 265°, 355°** (Golden Angle G3)
- **42°, 132°, 222°, 312°** (Golden Angle GC3)

#### Signal Strength Patterns
- **Strongest signals**: Sun, Mercury, Venus (traditional benefics)
- **Second tier**: Mars, Saturn, Pluto (traditional malefics)
- **Weakest**: Moon (possibly due to varying brightness)

#### Gauquelin Sector Correspondence
When summing all planetary effects relative to 0° Tropical Aries, the resulting pattern resembles the famous Gauquelin sectors - zones of enhanced planetary influence discovered in earlier statistical astrology research.

### Conclusions

The study supports 4 of 5 proposed assumptions:

✓ **Supported**:
- Names of celestial bodies correlate with semantic occurrences
- Harmonic angles show peak effects
- Different angles have distinct qualities
- Dynamic modulation occurs between bodies

✗ **Not Supported**:
- Brightness/size as primary importance factor (dim planets showed strong signals)

### Implications

1. **Linguistic-Astronomical Connection**: The correlation between orbital mechanics and news content suggests a "cosmic semiotics" - a symbolic language linking celestial movements to cultural expression.

2. **Retroactive Effects**: Minor planet names appear to "work" astrologically even before their discovery, raising questions about causality and the nature of symbolic systems.

3. **Methodological Innovation**: The study bypasses traditional astrological keywords by using astronyms (celestial names) as semantic primitives, providing more objective data points.

### Limitations & Future Directions

- **Data collection** ended prematurely due to Google News API changes
- **Single source** dependency (Google News only)
- Future research suggested:
  - Multiple news sources for validation
  - Sentiment analysis to differentiate benefic/malefic effects
  - Machine learning to isolate planetary meanings
  - Investigation of lunar phase effects on signal clarity

### Significance

This research provides quantitative evidence for astrological principles using rigorous signal analysis methods. The findings suggest that the traditional astrological framework of harmonic angles and planetary influences may reflect genuine patterns in the relationship between celestial mechanics and human cultural output, though the mechanism remains unexplained. The work bridges scientific methodology with astrological theory, offering a data-driven approach to examining ancient symbolic systems.

### Critical Considerations

While the correlations are statistically significant, several interpretive cautions apply:
- **Correlation vs. Causation**: The mechanism linking orbital positions to news content remains unexplained
- **Multiple Testing**: With 351,190 data points, some patterns may emerge by chance
- **Selection Bias**: The naming of minor planets and time period could influence results
- **Cultural Specificity**: Google News primarily reflects English-language Western media
